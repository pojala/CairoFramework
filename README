This is a Mac OS X framework Xcode project that contains Cairo + its dependencies.


The only new file is "CairoQuartz.h", which is the recommended header for inclusion
in Mac OS X projects, as it includes cairo.h and the Quartz-specific functions.

NOTE -- this version of Cairo is quite old.
It does build for all macOS architectures up to Big Sur and ARM64.
